## Part 1

Pretty simple, as any Day 1 puzzle should be. There might be something clever here to avoid the time complexity of the
sorting, but it's not obvious what it would be and as-written it's plenty fast.

## Part 2

Also easy. No idea what the time complexity of Array#count is, but it's probably O(n) so nothing to worry about there.
