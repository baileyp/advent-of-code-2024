# Advent of Code 2024

These are my solutions for the [2024 Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## Requirements

 1. Latest Ruby (as of the time of this project) with RSpec

## Setup

None, other than satisfying the requirements

## Running

```bash
ruby bin/run.rb
```

## Goals

- I am very busy this year so my primary goal is to just finish as many puzzles as possible.
- I will look for opportunities to re-use code between puzzles.
- I will look for opportunities to use Ruby features in interesting ways.
